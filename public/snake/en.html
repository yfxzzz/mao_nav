                    <h3>Game Background</h3>
                    <p>Snake is a classic casual game that originated from the 1976 arcade game "Blockade". It gained worldwide popularity in the 1990s with the spread of Nokia phones and became a memory for a generation. The core gameplay is simple yet challenging: players control a continuously moving snake, eating food to grow while avoiding collisions with walls or its own body.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Basic Rules</h3>
                    <p>1. The snake moves forward automatically, and players can only control its direction (up, down, left, right).</p>
                    <p>2. When the snake eats food, its body grows by one segment, and the score increases.</p>
                    <p>3. If the snake hits a wall or its own body, the game ends.</p>
                    <p>4. There is no time limit; the goal is to achieve the highest possible score.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Controls</h3>
                    <p>Desktop: Use the arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) on the keyboard to control the snake's direction.</p>
                    <p>Mobile: Tap the virtual direction buttons on the screen to control the snake's direction.</p>
                    
                    <h3>High Score Tips</h3>
                    <p>1. Plan your route: Try to make the snake move in large circles within the game area, avoiding sharp turns.</p>
                    <p>2. Use the boundaries: You can use the game area boundaries to change direction and avoid hitting yourself.</p>
                    <p>3. Control the pace: Move quickly when the snake is short, but slow down and operate carefully when it grows longer.</p>
                    <p>4. Stay calm: Don't panic in dangerous situations; calmly think about the best direction to move.</p>
                    <p>5. Practice reactions: Improve your reaction speed and operational precision through continuous practice.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Difficulty Settings</h3>
                    <p>The game offers three difficulty levels:</p>
                    <p>- Easy: The snake moves at a slower speed, suitable for beginners.</p>
                    <p>- Medium: The snake moves at a moderate speed, suitable for players with some experience.</p>
                    <p>- Hard: The snake moves at a faster speed, suitable for challenging players seeking a challenge.</p>
