                <h2>About Gobang</h2>
                <div class="description-content">
                    <p>Gobang, also known as Five in a Row, is an ancient strategy board game originating from China with a history spanning thousands of years. Its simple rules yet infinite variations have made it a favorite among players of all ages.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Game Rules</h3>
                    <p>Gobang is played on a 15×15 or 19×19 board with black and white stones. Players take turns placing stones at the intersections of the board lines. The first player to form an unbroken line of five stones (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. The black player traditionally moves first, as there is a slight advantage to being the first to play.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Historical Origins</h3>
                    <p>In ancient China, Gobang was known as "Lianzhu" (continuous beads) and can be traced back to oracle bone inscriptions from the Shang Dynasty. During the Tang Dynasty, Gobang was introduced to Japan by Chinese envoys, where it developed extensively. In the late 19th century, it spread to Europe and gradually became an internationally popular board game. Modern competitive Gobang typically uses a 15×15 board with strict rules and tournament systems.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Strategic Techniques</h3>
                    <p>Although Gobang has simple rules, mastery requires deep thinking and strategy. Here are some basic strategies:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>First-move Advantage</strong>: As the first player, black should take the initiative and strive to establish an early advantage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Defensive Counterattack</strong>: White usually adopts a defensive strategy while looking for counterattack opportunities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Open Three and Four</strong>: Creating an "open three" (three connected stones with empty spaces at both ends) and "four" (four connected stones that will form five) are common offensive tactics.</li>
                        <li><strong>Control the Center</strong>: The central area of the board is typically strategic; controlling it can limit the opponent's movement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Multi-purpose Moves</strong>: Ideal moves should serve both offensive and defensive purposes simultaneously.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Modern Development</h3>
                    <p>With the development of computer technology, Gobang has also become an important area of artificial intelligence research. After IBM's "Deep Blue" defeated the world chess champion in 1997, Gobang became the next board game challenged by AI. Today, top Gobang AI systems can defeat human world champions, demonstrating the powerful capabilities of artificial intelligence in strategic games.</p>
                    
                    <p>Whether as casual entertainment or competitive sport, Gobang continues to attract players worldwide with its easy-to-learn yet infinitely variable nature. Through this game, you can experience the joy of Gobang, exercise your thinking abilities, and enjoy the charm of strategic gaming.</p>
